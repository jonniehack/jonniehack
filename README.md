# Profile

Hi, I’m Jonathan. I am currently working as a Technical Consultant in the Cloud Endpoint practice at Phoenix Software (who, in recognition for outstanding achievements, have been awarded Microsoft Partner of the Year for 2023), specialising in the deployment and management of Microsoft Intune, a pivotal tool for modern device management and application deployment.

Beyond working with Microsoft Intune, I am passionate about PowerBI Reporting and PowerShell scripting. This interest extends beyond professional obligation, reflecting a genuine enthusiasm for the products and trying to apply them to everyday life. Whether supporting clients on their cloud journey, harnessing PowerBI for insightful data reporting or crafting PowerShell scripts to automate complex tasks day-to-day, I’m normally geeking out somewhere.

Outside of tech, I am a father, motorcyclist, petrol head and a big football & music fan.

…Thanks for visiting.

Jonathan.
